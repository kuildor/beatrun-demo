# beatrun-demo

**Current code and README are outdated. Go to [this repo ](https://github.com/JonnyBro/beatrun?tab=readme-ov-file) for more information.**



A re-upload of "Beatrun" — parkour gamemode for Garry's Mod. Currently in demo stage.

I love cheese, you know, put cheese on bread and make it melt in microwave, best thing ever. It's so hot you can't even touch it properly but want to take a bite - whole thing is tasty only when it's hot. I probably should do this tomorrow. And don't forget the tea - don't add sugar in it, let yourself taste cheese fully as you can. And then when everything is eaten you realize you have to wash it, melted cheese stuck on dish and later you try hard to wash it off.

You still reading this? Oh.
Well, you opened this page because your copy of beatrun is crashing, right? So, currently I can't help in this situation. The demo has been locked after the drama with banning CIS players. I'm not a reverse engineer, so I can't remove "timebomb-like" code, but if you can — you're welcome! Also, this repo is mostly being a template for the future modding. 

And I know that datae will be reading this. You will eventually find this repo and try to file a DMCA takedown. Well, what did I do wrong? I didn't omit any license, I'm not re-selling your mod, I just reuploaded a **free** demo! I'm not even insulting you, get real.

Just imagine, you get over 9000 dollars for the best parkour mod, and you will ban **ANY** CIS residents in your group/server cause some russian ret*rd called you a n**ger lover! What a circus!

> I don't have a problem with russians IRL

And you're banning slavic persons after buying the mod. Isn't that racism? Oh yeah, it is, and you admit this fact.

Imagine banning for being in >servers distributing pirated copies.

Funny moment — code which crashes GMod if the account has enabled "Family Sharing".

Also, datae is involved in the following:
— Doxxing
— Being Transphobic
— Crashing GMod servers using backdoors

Well, you knew about datae already. Nothing personal, just business.

Oh, BTW, I forgot about the maximal bruh moment.
